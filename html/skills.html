<h1>Skills</h1>

<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>
I have proficiency in several languages through coursework, my job experience and self-learning.  I know C++, Java, HTML, and CSS with a high degree of knowledge and skill.
I have some experience and exposure to Git and JavaScript.
</p>

<h2>Software</h2>
<p>
I am proficient in the use of several programs. The IDEs I am most confident are Eclipse, Netbeans, and Visual Studio. I used the Jekyll static website generator to make the pages on this website.
I am confident using the Atom text editor and experience using Vim. I have extensively used MATLAB during my coursework and will continue to use it in the coming semester with my coursework and research position.
I have used Microsoft Office and Google Docs throughout my schooling. Lastly I have used Mathematica to solve difficult math and physics problems for my minors.
</p>

<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
<p>
I have used variants of windows, OSX, and a few distros of Linux. I am practiced in using bash commands on a linux terminal. My exposure to iOS is limited compared to Android only using versions of 7.0 to 9.0 extensively.
I have personally used every version of Android since 2.0 including the 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0 developer previews. I am very familiar with the design guidelines for both mobile platforms.
</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>
My experience making this website, participating in several prominent open betas for video games and applications, and my use of the android developer previews have given me insight to good design.
I have been able to discern what makes software user friendly while maintaining features. The research position I am starting in the fall will further give me insight about good design.
</p>

<h2>Math and Physics</h2>
<p>
My pursuits of minors in Astrophysics and Math have given me greater problem solving skills. Physics problems often require creative thinking and high level math skills to complete successfully.
I have an understanding of how to model various real life systems and processes because of these extra classes. I have proficiency in Integral Calculus, Differential Calculus, Multivariable and Vector Calculus, and precollege mathematics.
I have exposure to differential equations, linear algebra, discrete math and calculus based statistics.
