<h1>Projects</h1>

<h2>This Website</h2>
<p>
In a period of about two weeks this past summer I went from knowing nothing about CSS, Javascript, GitHub and Jekyll to writing the code for this website.
Demonstrating my ability to pick up new languages and concepts this website came together rather quickly. I wanted to have something simple that would show off my portfolio and I feel this website does this.
Features include using Jekyll to generate the static pages, different views for mobile users and desktop users, a navigation bar, and a simple layout.
</p>
<p>
All of the code can be found on my GitHub linked <a href="https://github.com/skylerreimer/skylerreimer.github.io">here</a>.
I am the holder of the domain name and future plans are to implement my own email server.

<h2>Fundamentals OF Engineering Train Competition</h2>
<p>
The final project for the fundamentals of engineering class at Ohio State is the programming of a model train in MATLAB.
My group was tasked with writing code to meet several criteria and then we wrote a write-up on the code.
In my group I was the only computer science student so I wrote the entirety of the code for the project. My code received the highest score of all of the groups for the semester.
</p>
<p>
The train is programmed to do several things. It took advantage of a given API to complete these tasks.
The train changed speed based on what part of the track it was on, the “rural” section was faster than the “urban” section.
When the train entered the urban section the intersection gate went down after a slight delay using MATLAB’s tic and toc functions. The lights on the gate also flashes on and off during the gate process.
I completed extra credit that involved adjusting the train to specific inputted real life speed. The extra credit resulted in the highest score for my group.

Unfortunately, I cannot post the code on GitHub because my class’s rules on posting code online. Please email me at skylerreimer@gmail.com and I will gladly send you the code to look at.
The graded rubric showing my completion of all of the tasks and extra credit is <a href="../extras/rubric.jpg">here</a>.
