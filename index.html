            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Skyler Reimer and I am currently in my second year of computer science engineering at THE Ohio State University. This is a website I made to help me suppliment my resume by explaining my skills and projects further
            </p>

            <h2>What Are Your Interests In Computer Science?</h2>
            <p>
                I'm still taking intro classes so I have not really had time to explore all of the different fields inside of computer science. My endgame goal is to be a software engineer. 
                Right now my interests include networking and security because of the constant demand for new security solutions. I also gained an interest in web design while learning CSS and HTML to make this website.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Computer Science and not something else?</h2>
            <p>
                I am amazed by the fact that you can use a computer to solve almost any problem. This fact drives me to learn more about this field and has kept me attracted to computers from a young age. 
            </p>

            <h2>What else do you do? Any hobbies or interests?</h2>
            <p>
                Aside from coding I have a few other hobbies. I like to collect mechanical keyboards and their accessories. I also have a casual interest in physics and astronomy. 
                I am pursuing a minor in astrophyiscs in parallel to my degree in CS. I also enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, family and dog.
            </p>
