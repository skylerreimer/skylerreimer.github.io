<h1>Work Experience</h1>
<p>
In my relatively short time in college I have held a few positions relevant to software engineering and computer science, in general.
</p>

<h2>Student Research Assistant. Fall 2016-Present</h2>
<p>
In the fall I will be starting a research position with the Clinical Image Analysis Lab that is part of the Medical School here at Ohio State.
My primary responsibilities will be writing code in C++,Java, and MATLAB with some responsibilities maintaining and designing their website and user interfaces.
The research group specializes in writing software that can automatically detect different forms of cancer from clinical images.
</p>
<p>
From the original job posting the position I have â€œprovides excellent opportunities to develop a strong background in medical image analysis, web development, and big data management.
It was a competitive position and I had to pass two interviews to secure the position.

<h2>Teaching Assistant / Grader. Spring 2015-Spring 2016 </h2>
<p>
I was a teaching assistant for the department of Astrophysics and Astronomy at Ohio State. I was responsible for several components of the lab portion of Astronomy 1101.
I oversaw students as they completed a weekly two hour lab. This part of the job gave me strong skills in explaining complex concepts to people who are not themselves part of the field.
The students in the class were primarily business majors so they did not have strong backgrounds in physics and math.
This forced me to come up with creative explanations for the astronomy and physics concepts present in the class.
</p>
<p>
I was also responsible for ensuring the instructional aides were informed on what the weekly lab covered material wise.
This sometimes required explanation of concepts or set up to prepare the room for the students.
I had two separate students under me during this time. I was also responsible for grading the labs every week.
This was time consuming as I always made sure to grade as complete and as fair as possible.
</p>

<h2>Instructional Aide. Fall 2014</h2>
<p>
I was an instructional aide, before being promoted to Teaching Assistant, during my very first semester of college.
The primary duties of this position included keeping track of the attendance of 150+ students in the lecture and preparing the rooms for the students in lab. 
Other duties included inputting grades for students and taking care of various other small tasks.
