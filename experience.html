<h1>Work Experience</h1>
<p>
In my relatively short time in college I have held a few positions relevant to software engineering and computer science, in general.
</p>

<h2>Student Research Assistant. Fall 2016-Present</h2>
<p>
This fall I started working with the <a href="http://www.bmi.osu.edu/cialab/index.php">Clinical Image Analysis Laboratory</a>  which is a part of Ohio State’s medical center.
We write software that tries to detect cancer from tissue sample slides to assist Oncologists with their work.
Recently I have been using the Visual Studio IDE to assist in converting code from MATLAB to a more efficient C++.
The images we process can exceed ten gigabytes in size, so it is important that I do runtime analysis on everything I do. My responsibility is to make sure our software is as efficient as possible.
This position has been a great experience so far as I get to work in a team. Normally in my classes I have to work alone, so this job is a nice change of pace
</p>
<p>
So far I have implemented MATLAB code using the openCV library to handle the images. For example I have written a C++ version of the MATLAB function <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/bwareaopen.html?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com">“bwareaopen.”</a>
If you’d like to see some of my work I can talk to my supervisors and see what I’m allowed to show, please contact me.

<h2>Teaching Assistant / Grader. Spring 2015-Spring 2016 </h2>
<p>
I was a teaching assistant for the Department of Astrophysics and Astronomy at Ohio State. I was responsible for several components of the lab portion of Astronomy 1101.
I oversaw students as they completed a weekly, two hour lab. This job gave me strong communication skills as the students in my class were primarily
business majors and did not have strong science backgrounds.
This forced me to come up with creative explanations for the astronomy and physics concepts present in the class.
</p>
<p>
I was also responsible for coordinating with the instructional aides and ensuring they were up to date on course materials each week.
This sometimes required explanation of concepts or set up to prepare the room for the students.
I had two separate students under me during this time. I was also responsible for grading the labs every week.
This was time consuming as I always made sure to grade as complete and as fair as possible.
</p>

<h2>Instructional Aide. Fall 2014</h2>
<p>
I was an instructional aide, before being promoted to Teaching Assistant, during my very first semester of college.
The primary duties of this position included keeping track of the attendance of 150+ students in the lecture and preparing the rooms for the students in lab.
Other duties included inputting grades for students and taking care of various other small tasks.
